Well, I knew that you had no problem with this work (thanks again for presenting your results in class), all I have to comment on is **again**, could you please write code so that all the plots display. At least in spyder (this might be different if you're using studio) each sucessive plot overwrites the next one, so that I can only see the very last one you plot.
